**You can edit the speed of how fast it sends the messages by going to "time.sleep(2)" on main.py
If you remove it will send the messages fast but you will get ratelimited
You can change it to 1 second, 5 seconds and so on**

You can also change range() which is how many messages it will send before it stops.
